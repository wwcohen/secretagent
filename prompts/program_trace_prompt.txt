Consider the following documentation stub for a Python function.  Note
that this is documentation, not a full implementation.

```python
$stub_src
```

Imagine that this function was fully implemented as suggested by the
documentation stub, and that function were called with these arguments:

$args

Propose a possible output of the function for these inputs that is
consistent with the documentation.  Use the following output format:

<thought>
ANY THOUGHTS
</thought>
<answer>
FINAL ANSWER
</answer>

If your answer is x, show it as it would printed by a Python
interpreter called by print(x). Specifically if x is a string do NOT
include quotes around it.  Also, do not include any text other than
the final answer between the <answer> and </answer> tags.
