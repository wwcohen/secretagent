Consider the following documentation stub for a Python function.

```python
$stub_src
```

Suppose this function were correctly implemented, as suggested by
the documentation stub, and the implemented function were called
with these arguments: 

$args

What would the output of the function be? Use the following output
format:

<thought>
ANY THOUGHTS
</thought>
<answer>
FINAL ANSWER
</answer>

If your answer is x, show it as it would printed by a Python
interpreter called by print(x). Specifically if x is a string do NOT
include quotes around it.  Also, do not include any text other than
the final answer between the <answer> and </answer> tags.
