  bullwhip:
    name: bullwhip
    description: The bullwhip is old and worn, made of black leather.
  crowbar:
    name: crowbar
    description: >-
      The crowbar is about 4 feet long, and made of sturdy iron.
      You guess that it was abandoned by some previous grave
      robbers. There are no markings on it, and it could have been
      made ten years ago or two hundred.
  fedora:
    name: fedora
    description: The fedora is gray and stained but comfortable-looking.
  knife:
    name: knife
    description: >-
      The knife is dusty and so dark it is hard to focus on, but
      knife blade is about 10 inches long, made of obsidian, with
      razor-sharp edges. The handle is embossed and uncomfortable
      to hold, and studded with  jet-black pearls.
  phone:
    name: phone
    description: >-
      The phone is brand-new, state-of-the-art, and carefully
      engineered to be completely useless without the internet.

    neighbors:
      north: entrance
    description: >-
      You're in in front to an ancient pyramid.  The structure is
      old and crumbling, and looks to be thousands of years old.
      All around you is a wind-swept desert, dry and completely
      empty. To the north of you is a tunnel into the side of the
      pyramid, probably made by grave robbers long ago.

  entrance:
    name: entrance
    neighbors:
      south: start
      PATH: 
        start: entrance
        end: junction 1
        dirs: north north north
        name: robbers tunnel
        hint: a crude narrow tunnel
    description: >-
      You're at the entrance to crudely-made narrow tunnel, which
      leads up into the ancient pyramid at a steep angle.

  junction 1:
    name: junction 1
    neighbors:
      east: east passage
      west: west passage
    description: >-
      The narrow tunnel leads into a larger interior room. Faded
      hieroglyphics are painted on the huge stones that line the
      walls, along with dim images of animal-headed figures.  In
      the east, a broken cedar door with a broken seal is hanging,
      partly open.  In the west, there is a doorway with only a
      few remnants of the door that used to close it.
  east passage:
    name: east passage
    neighbors:
      west: junction 1
    description: >-
      The passage ends at a small room with a huge sarcophagus,
      with a heavy stone lid.  The lid is ornately carved but much
      too heavy to remove.
  west passage:
    name: west passage
    neighbors:
      east: junction 1
    description: >-
      The passage ends at small room with a huge sarcophagus. A
      broken stone lid lies on the ground next to it, ornately
      carved but severely damaged.
  in west sarcophagus:
    name: in west sarcophagus
    neighbors:
      south: west passage
      PATH: 
        start: in west sarcophagus
        end: raven room
        dirs: north north north
        name: dim passage
        hint: passage with pieces of broken statues on the floor
    description: >-
      You are inside a sarcophagus at the start of a dim passage
      leading north.

  raven room:
    name: raven room
    neighbors:
      north: raven statue
    description: >-
      You are in a large empty room, with empty niches on the east
      and west walls.  Most are empty, but midway through the
      room, in a niche on the east wall, is a life-sized stone
      statue of man with the head of a raven.
  raven room north:
    name: raven room north
    neighbors:
      south: raven statue
    description: >-
      In the north side of the room, some torn curtains hang in a
      makeshift frame.  There is a bundle of rags on the ground
      about halfway between the statue and the curtains.
  raven statue:
    name: raven statue
    neighbors:
      south: raven room
    description: >-
      The paint on the statue is faded, but visible, and when it
      was new it must have been impressive.  The eyes have been
      gouged out: perhaps they were jewels, and were stolen by
      robbers.  In spite of this it somehow seems that the statue
      follows you with its eyes as you cross the room, especially
      when you try and move past it, to the north.
